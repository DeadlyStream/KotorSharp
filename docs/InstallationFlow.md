# Installation Flow

I've tried this so many times that I've lost track of what I even want to do.

So I'm going to draw back a bit and make a TSLPatcher replacement first.

## Phase 1

### TSLPatcher Replacement

### User inputs commandline arguments
```
kpatcher <changes.ini> or <namespaces.ini>
```

### Load patch info from changes.ini

Most of the code for reading TSLPatchData changes.ini files is done

### Correctly Patch files
	
This is the hard part

## Phase 2

Mass install with direction from a metadata file
